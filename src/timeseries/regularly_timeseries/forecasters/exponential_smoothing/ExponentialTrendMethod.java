/**
 * Created by apolol92 on 21.08.15.
 * A variation from Holtâ€™s linear trend method is achieved by allowing the level and the slope to be multiplied
 * rather than added.
 * Where bt now represents an estimated growth rate (in relative terms rather than absolute)
 * which is multiplied rather than added to the estimated level.
 * The trend in the forecast function is now exponential rather than linear,
 * so that the forecasts project a constant growth rate rather than a constant slope.
